# Flash Drawing samples

ActionScript 3 has access to most aspects of the SWF environment. The first step to understanding how to work with ActionScript 3 is to understand how it relates to the visual environment. SWF applications are composed of timelines ([movie clips](https://web.archive.org/web/20140302041903/http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flash/articles/concept_movie_clip.html) or [sprites](https://web.archive.org/web/20140302041903/http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flash/articles/concept_sprite.html)) that act as containers for content and code. In ActionScript 3, timelines are display object containers and the visual elements within them are called [display objects](https://web.archive.org/web/20140302041903/http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flash/quickstart/display_list_programming_as3.html). The Drawing samples explore timelines, coordinate space, and ActionScript built-in drawing and color controls.
